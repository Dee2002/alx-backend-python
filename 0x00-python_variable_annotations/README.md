# 0x00 Python Variable Annotations

This directory contains Python scripts for various tasks related to variable annotations in Python. Each script implements a specific task with type annotations according to the provided requirements.

## Tasks:

1. **Basic annotations - add**: Type-annotated function to add two floats.
2. **Basic annotations - concat**: Type-annotated function to concatenate two strings.
3. **Basic annotations - floor**: Type-annotated function to return the floor of a float.
4. **Basic annotations - to string**: Type-annotated function to convert a float to its string representation.
5. **Define variables**: Definition and annotation of variables with specific values.
6. **Complex types - list of floats**: Type-annotated function to sum a list of floats.
7. **Complex types - mixed list**: Type-annotated function to sum a list of integers and floats.
8. **Complex types - string and int/float to tuple**: Type-annotated function to convert a string and int/float to a tuple.
9. **Complex types - functions**: Type-annotated function to return a function that multiplies a float by a given multiplier.
10. **Let's duck type an iterable object**: Type-annotated function for working with iterable objects.
11. **Duck typing - first element of a sequence**: Type-annotated function to safely get the first element of a sequence.
12. **More involved type annotations**: Type annotations for a function to safely get a value from a dictionary.
13. **Type Checking**: Type-annotated function for zooming in on an array.

Each task is implemented in a separate Python script with appropriate type annotations and is named accordingly.

## Requirements:

- All files should end with a newline
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Code should use `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5)
- All files must be executable
- Length of files will be tested using `wc`
- All modules, classes, and functions should have proper documentation following specified formats
